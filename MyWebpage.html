    <h2>Fibrant colors show you the way to antioxydants</h2>
    <p>The colors in fruits and vegetables are often a sign that they contain
    <em><b>antioxidants</b></em> that can be very powerful and often the more colorful variant has more
    than the green stuff. E.g. red onions have more antioxidants than white onions (76% more)
    and <em><b>red cabbage has eight times more than white!</b></em>

    <h2><div class="darkgreen">Dark green leafy vegetables </div></h2>
    <p>Dark green leafy vegetables are a good source of nutrients and Havard researches
    could show that <b>greens provide protection against major chronic diseases:</b>
    For every added daily serving the risk for heart attacks and stroke is reduced
    by 20%. </p>

    <h3>What is the better vor your health?</h3>
    <p class = "comicorange">A baked potato is obviously the better choice
    for your health when you compare it to french fries but
    <b>Sweet Potatoes</b> are by far the healthier option. They are a good
    source of potassium. An increase of an intake of potassium of 1.640 mg per day
    reduces the risk of stroke by 21 percent.<br>
    The phytonutrients found in the antioxidant pigments
    of sweet potatoes can even decrease the risk of depression.
